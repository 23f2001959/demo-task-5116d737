# Demo Task - Captcha Solver

## Summary
This project is a simple captcha solver that uses image recognition algorithms to automatically solve captchas. It is a demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems.

## Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3. Run the ```demo_task.py``` script to see the demo of the captcha solver in action.

## Usage
The captcha solver works by taking an image of a captcha as input and returning the solved captcha text. You can use this project as a basis for building more advanced captcha solving algorithms or integrate it into your own applications.

## Code Explanation
The project consists of the following files:
- ```demo_task.py```: Main script that demonstrates the captcha solver.
- ```captcha_solver.py```: Implementation of the captcha solving algorithm.
- ```requirements.txt```: List of dependencies required for the project.

The captcha solver uses image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize and interpret characters in the captcha image. It employs a combination of techniques such as image segmentation, feature extraction, and character recognition to accurately solve captchas.
